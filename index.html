            As the technical person you probably are as a computer science student, doing a course on writing
            might be quite intimidating. This FAQ page seeks to answer the grueling questions you might have to make
            sure you as comfortable as possible.

                <h2>Anticipating the differences (and similarities) between a communication class and a computer science class</h2>
                <p>
                    Taking a professional communications course varies greatly in focus from a technical computer science couse.
                    While computer science courses focus on understanding logic, the functional structure of systems, and
                    overall an engineering-focused mindset, in a course like this, we are focused on interpersonal relationships
                    with our readers and colleges. Thus, you are encouraged to think more empathetically rather than logically.
                    Not to be too stereotypical, but as a Computer Science major, I imagine you are more inclined toward the latter
                    rather than the former. Knowing this, you may have to push your limits a bit if you want to excel in this class. 
                    However, the one way your experience in computer science courses may translate to this course is you ability
                    to manage complex group activities which will play a role in writing your final report.

                <h2>Navigating the D2L site</h2>
                <p>
                    The structure of the D2L page may be confusing at first compared to what you are used to in CPS courses.
                    The main content of the D2L page you will need to access are split into these sections: the assignment
                    guidelines and references, the weekly course content, and the course slides (see figure 1 below). The
                    assignment guidelines and references contains the descriptions of your assignments and templates for some of them,
                    the weekly course content navigates you to pages with the readings and quizzes for a given week, and the course
                    slides page allows you to access the course slides for all the lectures.
